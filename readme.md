# 🎖️ Fogline  
*A Tactical War Game of Hidden Forces and Strategic Terrain*

**Fogline** is a two-player tactical battle game using only custom cards. It’s a spatial, fog-of-war strategy experience — no dice, no luck, just clever positioning, surprise reveals, and calculated attacks. Think *chess meets Stratego*, built entirely with cards.

## 🎯 Objective

Capture your opponent’s **Mobile Command** or eliminate all their other movable units. Outsmart your opponent with timing, terrain, and tactical reveals.

---

## 🧩 Components

Each player has **16 cards**:

- **8 Unit Cards**  
  Each unit has:
  - **Attack** value (when attacking)
  - **Defense** value (when defending)
  - Movement restrictions (based on terrain)

- **8 Terrain Cards**  
  Terrain types affect unit mobility and defense:
  - **Plains**: Open — all units can move here
  - **Forest**: Only light/foot units can enter; +1 Defense bonus
  - **Mountain**: Only Infantry and Scouts can enter

---

## 🛠 Setup

1. Players **take turns placing unit + terrain pairs**:
   - Place the **unit card face-down**
   - Cover it with a **terrain card face-up**
   - Cards must touch another card on the table **by one side** (not diagonally)

2. Terrain must match the unit’s movement ability (e.g., no Tanks under Mountains)

3. After 8 placements per player (16 total), the **battlefield is ready**

---

## 🔁 Turn Sequence

Players alternate turns. On your turn:

1. **Reveal a unit** (if hidden)  
2. **Choose an adjacent tile** to:
   - **Move** into (if empty and legal), OR
   - **Attack** (if occupied by an enemy unit)

3. **Resolve Combat** (if attacking):
   - Compare your **Attack** vs. enemy’s **Defense**
   - Add terrain bonuses (e.g., Forest = +1 Defense)
   - **Attacker wins ties**

4. **Remove defeated unit**, and move the winner into the tile

---

## 🚫 Movement Rules

- Only **orthogonal** movement (no diagonals)
- Units can’t move into impassable terrain
- Units can’t stack on each other
- Once revealed, units stay face-up

---

## 🏁 Victory

You win by either:

✅ Capturing the **enemy Mobile Command**, or
✅ Eliminating all other **movable enemy units**

## 🧠 Strategic Notes

- **Bluff with terrain**: hide powerful units under unassuming terrain  
- **Reveal wisely**: once revealed, units stay exposed  
- **Control the fogline**: use terrain to create chokepoints and trap opponents  
- **Trade effectively**: each unit is precious — think before you strike

---

## 🔄 Example Turn

> 🎮 Player 1 reveals a Tank (4 Att).  
> 🕵️ Attacks a hidden tile with Forest — reveals enemy Infantry (3 Def +1 = 4).  
> 🤜 Tie — attacker wins! Tank moves into the Forest tile.
